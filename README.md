# orb gaming Mini Arcade Machine - 240 in 1

I got an "Orb Gaming Mini Arcade Machine", with 240 games.

It is the one you can find in https://thumbsupuk.com/Products/Mini_Arcade_Machine . There is a more recent version, which you can distinguish because it doesn't say 'orb Gaming' on the front, and the games menu isn't a list of pages with eight games per page, but instead a menu separated by game genre.

The sort of guy that would find such a machine interesting (yeah, me) is also the sort of guy who would enjoy having more info about the games that are available in here, including a list of games, information about them, links and so on. Unfortunately, a few of these games don't seem to be documented anywhere. So... well, I decided to create a small repository -- for now just one markdown file, to list the games, add info about them, and so on. If you know more about some of these games (even if you don't have them on the same mini arcade machine!), feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.

##   1 - F22

### About the game

This is the Waixing edition of F-22. The name of the game seems to be "F-22", even if the menu calls it "F22". More info here: https://tcrf.net/F-22

### My personal progress

I can reach the 1st level boss, but not kill it.

This edition is supposed to have 3 levels.

##   2 - Vanguard

### About the game

This is not the space shooter arcade Vanguard, but the tank shooter. A video of it in action can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR--6_kXMFc

### My personal progress

I can reach stage 3.

##   3 - Abscondee

### About the game

Pick the items, avoid the traps, reach the exit -- all within the alloted time. More info here: https://tcrf.net/Abscondee

### My personal progress

I can reach stage 2.

##   4 - Aether Cruiser
