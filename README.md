# orb gaming Mini Arcade Machine - 240 in 1

I got an "Orb Gaming Mini Arcade Machine", with 240 games.

It is the one you can find in https://thumbsupuk.com/Products/Mini_Arcade_Machine . There two (at least) more recent versions, which you can distinguish because the games menu has categories on what I'm calling versions 2 and 3. The 3rd version doesn't say 'orb Gaming' on the front, either. I do not know if the actual games on those versions are the same.

The sort of guy that would find such a machine interesting (yeah, me) is also the sort of guy who would enjoy having more info about the games that are available in here, including a list of games, information about them, links and so on. Unfortunately, a few of these games don't seem to be documented anywhere. So... well, I decided to create a small repository -- for now just one markdown file, to list the games, add info about them, and so on. If you know more about some of these games (even if you don't have them on the same mini arcade machine!), feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.

##   1 - F22

### About the game

This is the Waixing edition of F-22. The name of the game seems to be "F-22", even if the menu calls it "F22". More info here: https://tcrf.net/F-22

### My personal progress

I can reach the 1st level boss, but not kill it.

This edition is supposed to have 3 levels.

##   2 - Vanguard

### About the game

This is not the space shooter arcade Vanguard, but the tank shooter. A video of it in action can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR--6_kXMFc

### My personal progress

I can reach stage 3.

##   3 - Abscondee

### About the game

Pick the items, avoid the traps, reach the exit -- all within the alloted time. More info here: https://tcrf.net/Abscondee

### My personal progress

I can reach stage 2.

##   4 - Aether Cruiser

### About the game

https://tcrf.net/Aether_Cruiser

### My personal progress

I can reach stage 2.

##   5 - Aim Cruise

### About the game

https://tcrf.net/Aim_Cruise

### My personal progress

Aim Cruise game's over if you manage to play for 99 seconds without losing, which I do, reaching level 4.

##   6 - Air Alert

### About the game

This seems to be a variant to another "Air Alert": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYnUBDAu8V4 . This one has only the choice of "1 Plane" on the main menu, has black background there and yellow letters, instead of the purple and orange seen on that video. The game has audio, but the title screen has not.

### My personal progress

At least this version of Air Alert comes with infinite lives.

##   7 - Star

### About the game

I find no information about this game online. This is *not* the hack of the Snafu game, of the same name. For better reference, here's a picture of the game's title screen:

### Personal progress

I've played this game until level 3, during which I decided to quit.

##   8 - Levin Action

### About the game

This is a modded version of Defender.

### Personal progress

I reach wave 2.

##   9 - Animal Blockes

### About the game

This is a Mahjong game, where the blocks are images of animals. A reference to its existence can be found here: https://tcrf.net/Angry_Birds_(NES,_2012)

### Personal progress

Stage 4.

##  10 - Animal Contest

### About the game

This is a game with the mechanics of the "War" cards game. More info here: https://tcrf.net/Animal_Contest

### Personal progress

What can be said of a game like this? You play, if you're lucky you win, if you're not you loose.

##  11 - Balloon Shoot

### About the game

### Personal progress

You have 60 seconds to do your best, and that's it...

## 12 - Bicycle

### About the game

There is more than one variant of this game, because when I initially searched about it, I found a video (unfortunately no longer available) of the same game, but with more options in the start menu. On this variant, the only starting choice is level 1.

### Personal progress

I reach level 2.

## 13 - Blob Buster

### About the game

Blog Buster is [an hack](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/1410/) of [Dig Dug II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dig_Dug_II). But in this arcade, even Blog Buster was hacked: the main screen only shows the 1 Player option, but does not hide the 2UP text on the top right corner. Nothing under the 1 Player option shows (including the credits).

### Personal progress

I reached lvel 5.

## 14 - Boat Race

### About the game

A "road fighter" hack: same game, different graphics.

### Personal progress

6400 (level 1).

## 15 - Brother Ball

### About the game

Some info [here](https://tcrf.net/Brother_Ball). The levels get bigger, but the difficulty does not increase.

### Personal progress

I reached stage 7 before I quited. Might be interesting to try to play it through, just to figure out how many levels are there... and as a resistence to boredom test.
